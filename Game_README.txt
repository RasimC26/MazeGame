D) The theme of my game is supposed to be a challenge in which you are worrying about 2 different threats,
the maze walls and the moving dodgeballs, but you have help in certain levels, the banana, which does different things at different
times. Basically this game is meant to challenge you to not just go through the maze but also avoid the dodgeballs. The goal is
to throw off the user, yes its a maze game, but not your average maze game.

Work Section
a. I have spent between 10-12 hours on my game.
b. My biggest victory was finding out how to change levels instead of staying on one, because that was a great challenge.
Another great challenge was determining how to make the character stay on the screen. In the end i am pleased with the game and
am grateful for the things i learned during the process.
